# Intro

This course is on the design and implementation of database management systems. Topics include data models (relational, document, key/value), storage models (n-ary, decomposition), query languages (SQL, stored procedures), storage architectures (heaps, log-structured), indexing (order preserving trees, hash tables), transaction processing (ACID, concurrency control), recovery (logging, checkpoints), query processing (joins, sorting, aggregation, optimization), and parallel architectures (multi-core, distributed). Case studies on open-source and commercial database systems are used to illustrate these techniques and trade-offs. The course is appropriate for students that are prepared to flex their strong systems programming skills.

learning objectives-

- Use relational algebra to express database queries.
- Use SQL to interact with database management systems.
- Design appropriate database tables, using functional dependencies and normal forms.
- Implement a disk-oriented database storage manager with table heaps and indexes.
- Understand, compare, and implement the fundamental concurrency control algorithms.
- Implement database recovery algorithms and verify their correctness.
- Identify trade-offs among database systems techniques and contrast distributed/parallel alternatives for both on-line transaction processing and on-line analytical workloads.
- Interpret and comparatively criticize database system architectures.
